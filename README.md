## Problem Statement
Limited appointment slots, long waiting times, and the hassle of physically visiting multiple pharmacies are common issues faced by patients.

Additionally, keeping track of paper prescriptions and maintaining a comprehensive medical history can be cumbersome for both patients and healthcare providers.

These challenges highlight the need for a modern solution that streamlines the process, improves accessibility, and enhances overall healthcare experiences.

2) Make appropriate APIs
3) Make a next and django based web app
4) designs for the web app - https://www.behance.net/gallery/171126515/Medicos-Appointment-booking-made-easy-UX-case-study/modules/965648159

# Solution
## 1) Streamline Appointment Management: 
Our goal is to revolutionize the way appointments are scheduled and managed. By offering a comprehensive system that allows patients to search for doctors based on specialty, location, and availability.
## 2) Enable Prescription Tracking and Management: 
Our web app aims to simplify the process of maintaining and accessing medical prescriptions. By allowing users to upload and store their digital prescriptions securely, we provide a centralized platform for easy retrieval and management.
## 3) Facilitate Medicine Purchase: 
Our goal is to provide a platform where users can easily search for nearby pharmacies, browse through a wide range of medicines, and make purchases online.
